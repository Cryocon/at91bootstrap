Compiling an at91bootstrap project

1 GNU ARM Toolchain
===========================================================================================
1.1 Linux

AT91Bootstrap 3.0  has been compiled and tested under Linux using the following GNU ARM Toolchain
- Coudesourcery 2007 Q1
- Coudesourcery 2008 Q1

- Toolchain generated by OE
- Toolchain generated by Buildroot

1.2 Windows

AT91Bootstrap 3.0 should work under Cygwin but without testing
Note: Cygwin can be downloaded from the following URL:http://www.cygwin.com/

1.3 Compiling DataFlashBoot
===========================================================================================

Let's use AT91SAM9260EK as an example,

$ cd <project directory>
$ make at91sam9260df_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/


1.4 Compiling NandFlashBoot
===========================================================================================

Let's use AT91SAM9G45EKES as an example,

$ cd <project directory>
$ make at91sam9g45nfes_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.5 Compiling SDCardBoot
===========================================================================================

Let's use AT91SAM9G45EKES as an example,

$ cd <project directory>
$ make at91sam9g45sd_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/



2 Microsoft's Toolchain
===========================================================================================

AT91Bootstrap 3.0  has been compiled and tested with

- Microsoft's Platform Builder 6.0


2.1 Building Procedure
===========================================================================================
[1] Open any WinCE project in OSDesigns folder
[2] Open menu item (Build -> Open Release Directory in Build Window)
[3] Goto directory <Bootstrap project>\wince\buildscripts
[4] build.bat [EK_TYPE] [MEDIA_TYPE] [IMG_TYPE]
        - EK_TYPE can be: 9260 9261 9263 9rl 9g10 9g20 9g45 9m10 9g45ekes 9m10ekes all
		- MEDIA_TYPE can be: dataflash nandflash sdcard all
		- IMG_TYPE can be: eboot cekernel uboot linuxkernel gettingstarted all

If the building process is successful, the images will be generated in wince\output folder
